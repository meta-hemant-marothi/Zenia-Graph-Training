The fork with 100mm of travel absorbs rough terrain. Fat Kenda Booster tires give you grip in corners and on wet trails. The Shimano Tourney drivetrain offered enough gears for finding a comfortable pace to ride uphill, and the Tektro hydraulic disc brakes break smoothly.

This is the tiniest kidsâ€™ pedal bike on the market available without a coaster brake, the Jigger is the vehicle of choice for the rare tenacious little rider raring to go. We say rare because this smokinâ€™ little bike is not ideal for a nervous first-time rider, but itâ€™s a true giddy up for a true speedster. The Jigger is a 12 inch lightweight kids bicycle and it will meet your little oneâ€™s need for speed. Itâ€™s a single speed bike that makes learning to pump pedals simple and intuitive. It even has  a handle in the bottom of the saddle so you can easily help your child during training!  The Jigger is among the most lightweight childrenâ€™s bikes on the planet. It is designed so that 2-3 year-olds fit comfortably in a molded ride position that allows for efficient riding, balanced handling and agility. The Jiggerâ€™s frame design and gears work together so your buddingbiker can stand up out of the seat, stop rapidly, rip over trails and pump tracks. The Jiggerâ€™s is amazing on dirt or pavement. Your tike will speed down the bike path in no time. The Jigger will ship with a coaster brake. A freewheel kit is provided at no cost. '},\n",
